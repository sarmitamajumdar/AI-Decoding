# Decoding the Invisible: How AI Transforms Data into Human-Centered Visualizations
  ## Subtitle

   Exploring AI’s role in decoding complexity with Python-powered interactive visualizations

### Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) excels at decoding complexity—from brain signals to language patterns. Yet, without visualization, those decoded insights remain inaccessible to humans.

This project demonstrates how Python-powered interactive visualizations can explore how AI transforms data into human-centered insights, bridging complex machine outputs with intuitive understanding.

### Objectives

Explore the role of AI in decoding data (language, brain signals, complex systems).

Showcase visualization as a bridge between machine output and human understanding.

Implement an interactive Python + Plotly visualization of decoded embeddings.

Highlight the bioethical importance of interpretability and transparency.

### Tech Stack

Python 3.9+

Plotly → Interactive visualization

Scikit-learn → PCA, ML utilities

Pandas & NumPy → Data handling
